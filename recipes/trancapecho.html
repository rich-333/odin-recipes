    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      The trancapecho or tranca pecho is a type of sandwich originating in Cochabamba (Bolivia), from the Caracota neighborhood. It comes from the silpancho, but differs from it in that it has a toco or tortilla bread. All the ingredients, including the rice and bread, are typical of this city.</p>
    <p>
      In Cochabamba, this dish can be found in the markets.4 The creation of trancapecho is attributed to Ana Camacho, better known as Dona Anita, a vendor at the Las Islas food court, who created the word from conversations with her customers when they consumed the product.
