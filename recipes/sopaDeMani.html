      Peanut soup is a very popular soup throughout Bolivia. In recent years, it has been named one of the country's signature dishes.
      Although the origin of this recipe is unknown, it is said that peanuts originate in Bolivia, as they were cultivated in South America before the arrival of the conquistadors.

      Like every dish or recipe, within the country there are variations depending on the climate and terrain of the cities.
      In some areas, it's served with rice, yuca, and plantains. In the valley, a little red chili is added and goat or beef and potatoes are used.
      In the highlands, it's usually served with lamb and fried potatoes.
