    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Peanut soup is a very popular soup throughout Bolivia. In recent years, it has been named one of the country's signature dishes.
      Although the origin of this recipe is unknown, it is said that peanuts originate in Bolivia, as they were cultivated in South America before the arrival of the conquistadors.

    <p>
      Like every dish or recipe, within the country there are variations depending on the climate and terrain of the cities.
      In some areas, it's served with rice, yuca, and plantains. In the valley, a little red chili is added and goat or beef and potatoes are used.
      In the highlands, it's usually served with lamb and fried potatoes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of raw, shelled peanuts</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided into two parts</li>
      <li>1 medium garlic clove, minced</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon parsley, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled</li>
      <li>1 medium carrot, julienned</li>
      <li>4-6 cups vegetable broth or water, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup uncooked mostaccioli (small pasta)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of turmeric, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>2 medium potatoes, diced or sliced</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the peanuts for about 30 minutes, or until soft. Let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and sauté the garlic, onion, parsley, and oregano until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the carrots and cook for 2 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 4 cups of water or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer covered for about 30 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the soup is cooking, prepare the peanut paste. Place the boiled peanuts in a blender or food processor and blend with a cup of water or broth until you get a thick, smooth paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the paste into a pan with 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the turmeric and stir for 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the mixture to the soup pot, stirring to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the remaining oil in a pan and toast the mostaccioli pasta. Stir constantly to prevent burning. This helps the pasta hold its shape while cooking in the soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pasta to the soup in the last 15 minutes of cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before serving, add the cooked potatoes and chickpeas. The soup should have a thick consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the soup and add salt if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a thinner soup is desired, add the remaining water or broth until the desired consistency is obtained.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve in bowls, garnished with chopped parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
